# COMP3511 Project 1 Spring 2019

## Introduction

This project covers entry-level Linux system programming. Students are 
required to finish a multi-process application using Linux system calls, such 
as `fork()` and `pipe()`. The aim of this project is to help students understand 
the basic idea of process and inter-process communication methods and gain 
first-hand experience in related programming works.

## Project Requirement

### Product

You are required to finish a multi-process batch calculator. The calculator 
reads a text file containing arithmetic expressions and calculates the 
expressions with floating point accuracy using arbitrary number of child 
processes. The program should be executed with the following command: 
`multical.out input.txt output.txt 5`, where `input.txt` is the input file name 
and `output.txt` is the output file name, and `5` means 5 child process will be 
created to calculate the expressions in `infile.txt`. The program can only read 
the input file after the `5` child processes are forked.

### Input Format

Your program should read a text file. Each line is an expression the program 
needs to calculate. An empty line denotes the end of processing. The text file 
is formated as following:

```
[expression]\n

[expression]    := [expression][expression]
[expression]    := [id] [number] [operation] [number]\n
[id]            := #[integer]
[number]        := [integer]
[number]        := [floating point number]
[operation]     := +
[operation]     := -
[operation]     := *
[operation]     := /
```

### Sample Input

Note: `'\n'` is converted to line break in this sample.

```
#0 1 + 1
#1 2 * 5
#2 385 / 134
#3 153.23 - 54324
#4 5.64 - 0.873

```

### Output Format

Your program should write the output to a new file. The output starts with a 
line stating the pid of parent process. Follows the result of the calculations,
line-by-line, with the corresponding `[id]` and the pid of the processing 
child, `[by]`. Every answer should be formatted to 3 decimal points, 
regardless the answer has decimals or not. Ordering of `[id]` is not 
important. An empty line denotes the end of answers.

```
[parent pid]\n[result]\n

[result] := [result][result]
[result] := [id] [by] [floating point number]\n
[id]     := #[integer]
[by]     := [integer]
```

### Sample Output

Note: `'\n'` is converted to line break in this sample. Suppose `1020` is the 
pid of parent, `1021 ~ 1024` are pids of children.

```
1020
#1 1021 10.000
#3 1022 âˆ’54170.770
#0 1024 2.000
#2 1023 2.873
#4 1025 4.767

```

### Even distribution of work

Every child should get the same amount of work. Each child should get at most 
1 more calculation to work on comparing to other children. It is recommended 
to use round robin task distributing. Failing to distribute the calculations evenly will result in a 10 point deduction in the completion points.

### Tools

You are only allowed to use C language, and specific functions for specific 
tasks:

1. `fork()` for spawning child process, `getpid()` to get current process pid. 
You are not allowed to use other means of concurrent/ parallel processing. 10 
points will be deducted from completion points if other multi-processing functions 
is used.

2. `pipe()` or `mkfifo()` for inter-process communication. `shm_open()` related 
functions and `socket()` are also allowed, but not recommended. Use of other means
of IPC will result in 10 points deducted from completion points.

3. `printf()`, `dprintf()`, `fprintf()` and `stdio.h` related functions are 
thread-safe functions, as required in POSIX standard. You don't need to worry
about race conditions when using them. Use other output functions carefully.
Do check the manual `man 7 attributes` and man pages of the functions if you are 
not sure about thread-safety issues.

## Project Completion

There are two ways you can complete the project.

### From scratch

Create the calculator from scratch. You get full mark if you comply with the 
rules and complete the project. Partial marks is given according to the
completeness comparing to the skeleton if the submission is not complete.

### From skeleton

Skeleton is provided. You get the marks for completing different missing parts 
of the calculator. Marks for different parts are noted in the skeleton source 
files.

### Code explanation

Either ways, you might need to explain the code. Marks will be deducted if you 
fail to explain your own code. So don't try to copy from others or the 
Internet, or be smart when copying.

## Marks

1. Completion: 70% - See the `//TODO`s in the skeleton code files for skeleton partial marks.

2. Explanation: 30%

3. Plagirism: Instant 0

## Submission

Tar gzip your source code folder and submit the `.tar.gz` file to CASS. The deadline for submission is 29 March, 23:59.

## Materials

### Skeleton code

The skeleton has the following folder structure:
```
.
bin
    multical.c
include
    expression.h
    fd.h
src
    expression.h
    fd.h
test
    t_expression.h
Makefile
README.md
infile
```

#### Makefile

You can use `make` in the project directory to compile everything. The makefile is
ready to use as long as you follow the folder structure below.

#### `bin`

`./bin/` is the folder for executable sources. An executable `.out` file is 
generated for each `.c` file in the `./bin/` folder. For example, the 
`./bin/multical.c` file in  will be compiled into `./bin/multical.out`.

The file `./bin/multical.c` is the skeleton file you need to modify. Add
code to the missing parts of the file.

#### `include` and `src`

`./include/` and `./src/` stores the source files for auxillary functions and
data structures. `./src/` stores the `.c` files and `./include` stores the `.h` files.

`./include/expression.h` and `./src/expression.c` helps you with handling the 
expression strings. You can use these in your project code.

#### `test`

`./test/` is the folder for testing of auxillary functions. 
`./test/t_expression.c` provided a nice example of how you can write a test
for your own function. Testing is not required in project submission.

### Required knowledge

#### Unix API

1. `fork()`

2. `wait()`

3. `getpid()`

4. `pipe()` or `mkfifo()`

You can always use `man 2 [function]` or `man 3 [function]` to see the documents. Manual section 2 is Liunx specific and section 3 is Unix in general. 

#### C Library

1. `fdopen()` converts an `int` fd into a `FILE *` file pointer that can be used
with `stdio.h` standard I/O functions.

2. `fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fscanf()`, `fprintf()` and other `stdio.h` functions
that deals with file and I/O. Beware that these I/O functions have their internal buffer which has to be `fflush()`ed to take effect.
